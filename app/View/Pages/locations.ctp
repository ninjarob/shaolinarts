I have not only learned                techniques to defend myself, but more importantly have <em>learned more about myself</em>. Kung Fu and                Tai Chi are wonderful tools to help you become a better person. <em>The teachers are great</em> with so                much knowledge and experience they are willing to share. Shaolin Arts and Si Gung Gracey can and have                helped me along my path.
