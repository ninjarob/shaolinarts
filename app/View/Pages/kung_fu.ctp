The forms, the animal patterns, the applications for self defense are                really cool. Yesterday, we worked on these huge crane movements and then we applied it to a crowed                elevator. I never thought you could use the energy of such big movements in such as small space. My body                felt so powerful and my mind understood why. I love it.

I thought I had pushed myself to my utmost physical                limitations and abilities. A year ago I joined Shaolin Arts; I have never in my life been better. I am                fit, mentally and physically more so, then I have ever been in my life. I have overcome limitations that                I did not think were possible to over come, I have faced my fears both physical and mental. I have                realized that the only limitations that I have are those that I place upon myself. I have had the added                benefit of not only losing weight, but inches as well as becoming toned.<br/>Daeen Hughes</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('TreeBag.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Arts Student striking a tree bag')) ?>            <p>Retreat, 2009</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('Retreat2007.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Arts Retreat')) ?>            <p>playing in the spiders web, balance, balance, balance.</p>            <p>Shane and I had been searching for a new 'dojo' home ever since returning to SLC from Los Angeles. The                task of finding one fell primarily on me since Shane was having to pull the normal 14 hour days for his                company. I knew what I was looking for when I went searching. Professionalism, uniforms, a clean dojo, a                studio not held in the basement of a home, study guides by the school itself as well as a record of its                history, and most importantly-a studio that 'felt' good. All of these questions and desires where both                answered and met the first time I spoke with Mr. Gracey, which was also my first visit. We signed up,                and now, nearly three years later we are pleased, happy, and continuing to learn<br/>Shytei M.

Today, Kung Fu can refer to the healing arts,fighting, self defense,fitness,                knowledge,health, chi, etc. To be a true Master at one thing, one must know a lot about a lot of                things.It was largely Hollywood movies that gave the impression the term Kung Fu only refers to Chinese                fighting or martial arts. Yes, Shaolin Kung Fu is a very famous and effective fighting system. History                has shown time and time again how good it is. Almost all known types of martial arts came from the                systems of Shaolin.</p>            <p>Some individuals prefer the term Gung Fu instead of Kung Fu or Wushu, etc. With three different major                written forms of the Chinese language alone and over 400 different spoken, confusion in terms can grow                quickly. With the Arts embracing many different peoples, countries and time period’s languages did                change. Our goal here is to understand the meaning behind the Arts and the results that have and can                happen in practicing them. Languages and cultures can be beautiful, but they are just tools to explain                and feel what is really happening - to touch the substance within.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('flyingchrisGrey.jpg', array('alt'=>'flying kicks, kung fu, mixed martial arts,')) ?>            <p>As Kung Fu Artists, our goal is excellence. Excellence in all we do. To be at peace with all the world                around us. Not to abuse, not to be abused. In the possess of gaining proficiency in our Arts we discover                ourselves, enlightenment, understanding, confidence, self awareness are all terms to describe the                experience. We laugh; and sometimes cry. We sweat; we ponder; we share; we truly live. In the end we                experience the joy of growth, the empowerment and the freedom that it brings. It’s fun, it’s rewarding,                it develops; it’s real. It builds upon all the good that is in us. Yes there is a myriad of kicks, multi                hand strikes, stances, grabs, weapons, and patterns or techniques thousands of years old to utilize, for                control, to heal with and to energize. In the end you just have to experience good Kung Fu to                understand. Come in. There is no time like the present to discover, to enjoy the adventure.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('CWorkBowPunchGrey.jpg', array('alt'=>'bow stance, Kung Fu, mixed martial arts')) ?>            <p>Many refer to the Arts of Kung Fu or Karate as either internal, meaning developing or dealing with the                internal parts of the body, and external, meaning the external or outer shell of the body. Internal is                likewise thought of, as being soft or gentle in movement while external is only hard or focused. There                really is no such thing in the Arts. Rather there is some degree of both in all. One type or style of                Art may have become more known for being soft or hard, gentle or focused, but both are still needed,                just like the outside of the body has need of the inside and the inside needs the outside. Neither can                live without the other. Karate styles such as Japan’s Wado Ryu or Korea’s Tae Kwon Do, tend to be linier                with a force meets force type philosophy while Kung Fu styles more circular, redirecting energy, if                compared to each other. Again, this may tend to be true, but there are still very ‘hard’ styles of Kung                Fu and very ‘soft’ ones as well.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('3girlscutoutGrey.jpg', array('alt'=>'kicks, kung fu, mixed martial arts, women')) ?>            <p>At Shaolin Arts Kung Fu we teach by the five classic Shaolin Animals: tiger, leopard, dragon, crane and                snake. Or, simply put, Shaolin Chuan Fa. Within this complete system both hard and soft, focus with                fluidity, are embraced. Each Shaolin Arts animal represents a different body type and personality. The                tiger is known for its strength and tenacity. It is used to being the biggest and strongest animal in                the jungle using direct force in confrontations. As long as you are the biggest and strongest tiger this                is a good method. The weakness of the tiger is that it can be ‘out foxed’. The leopard is known for its                speed. Rapid multiple strikes with coordinated footwork are utilized. Boxing would be one example of a                sport evolving from leopard techniques. The crane is known for its balance. It is more conservative,                keeping its main body back while reaching out with its wings and beak. The last thing the crane wants to                do is grapple. The snake uses wrapping movements and poisonous strikes. The sports of judo, jujitsu,                wrestling, and aikido all came from the snake. Poisonous strikes are the pressure point strikes Kung Fu                is famous for. The dragon is mystical. It is the thinker. Whipping and whirling with hidden strikes is                its trademark. It understands and can use all the other four animals to fulfill it’s needs and purpose.                Put together these five animals create a complete package or program of the Arts.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('youthFemaleAnna.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Arts, Kung Fu, CHuan Fa, self defense, mixed martial arts, karate, fitness,')) ?>            <p>Shaolin Arts is a family system thousands of years old and has survived because it works. MMA, Mixed                Martial Arts, has become a term used today referring to an aggressive sport type event for the                entertainment of spectators. More than one 'style' or type of martial art is used. Using more than one                style, or a complete program of arts is what Shaolin Arts Kung Fu programs have always done. Just like                people, each Kung Fu animal has its strengths and weakness due to individual body style and personality.                For example, in self defense applications, kicks are an excellent too,l but, if you are standing on a                patch of ice, or wearing a tight dress, you may not be able to throw too many kicks. If someone gets                behind you and pulls you down to the ground different skills are needed. What if you have more than one                attacker? If weapons are used? etc. Putting all the animal styles together, as traditionally done,                creates a complete package or system of Arts. Our goal is to teach you all the principles of the Arts                and you will naturally gravitate to the style that works best for you.</p>            <p>We do have students who study just one aspect of the art. It may be a weapon, self defense, sport, or the                health and fitness it generates. Let us know ahead of time and we can set up a specialized program.</p>            <p>Kung Fu weapon training can give the body great feedback because weapons are just an extension of the                body. Any error the body makes the weapon will exaggerate. They are wonderful tools for developing the                mind and body. Certain traditional weapons aid in this process more than others. Thus at Shaolin Arts                Kung Fu, for those students who are interested, we like to introduce classic or traditional weapons                training. Secondly, weapons are a part of our society. Understanding how they work increases our                understanding of how to defend against them. Ancient principles well understood, only improve one’s                skill and responsibilities with the weapons of our time.</p>            <p>Come in and enjoy our programs; the fun, fitness, depth and results are wonderful.</p>        </section>    </div></div>
