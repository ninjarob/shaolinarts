Some individuals  come in everyday and programs are set up for them, and we have programs that we take to private homes and businesses where the individuals or groups rarely, if ever, come to the studio location. The more you can be involved the better. But, quality is more important than quantity. Take the time you have and really use it, and you’ll grow.</p>

Others discover there is a lifetime of material available - a lifetime of growth, adventure, fun.  Shaolin Arts strives to make each class worthwhile. All of us have found remaining active in the Arts improves our quality of life, our very whole being. Staying active makes everything else we do better.</p>

                                <p>The shout, the Kiai’ or ‘Qihe’ helps you focus your energy. At first it is more external and with proper practice, becomes more internal. The sound itself is unimportant. We will all develop our own sounds or tones as we advance. It is the results we are after not just the sound effects. This is not to be confused with the classic healing sounds taught in our Qi Gung exercises.</p>

                                <p>Traditional often refers to old or ancient ways verses modern relating to our own time period and circumstances. In the Arts something that is thousands of years old may be just old and outdated, or it might mean is has ‘stood the test of time’, that all through the ages nothing has ever been invented better. Certain techniques worked in the past because of the core principles they utilized and therefore will work well now, in our times and circumstances if we can be taught the same methods. When we understand why and how things worked in the past we can have all their strengths for the future.</p>

                                <p>Yes. Weapons are an extension of the body. Any error the body makes the weapon will exaggerate. Therefore weapon training can give the body great feedback. They are wonderful tools for developing the mind and body. Certain traditional weapons aid in this process more than others. Thus at Shaolin Arts, for those students who are interested, we like to introduce classic or traditional weapons training. Secondly, weapons are a part of our society. Understanding how they work increases our understanding of how to defend against them.</p>

                                <p>There are many masters of the Arts who feel and have experienced how sport and competition have destroyed the Arts. How techniques were ruined that had to be ‘watered down’ to make them safe enough for playing around with but  never really used. How the skills deteriorated when all one had to do was pretend to hit rather than have to make their movements work. How more trophies are won by the Hollywood type appearance of energy and power rather than real power and ability. </p>
                                <p>On the other hand, sport or competition type activities can develop the desirable skills of coordinating your movements with another’s. Good sportsman-like behaviors can develop with well-run activities. The idea is to use sport for the strengths it can develop and not confuse sport skills with true street or fighting skills. At Shaolin Arts, you can have Arts that are fun to do and still be powerful and effective.</p>

Learning from a mystical stranger from some foreign land can be fun at first and impress others but in the long run you learn through good communication and teaching skills.

They came from throughout the world to share and grow (see history section for more details).</p>

                                <p>Many refer to the Arts as either internal, meaning developing or dealing with the internal parts of the body, and external, meaning the external or outer shell of the body. Internal is likewise thought of, as being soft or gentle in movement while external is only hard or focused. There really is no such thing in the Arts. Rather there is some degree of both in all. One type or style of Art may have become  known for being more soft or hard, gentle or focused, but both are still needed, just like the outside of the body has need of the inside and the inside needs the outside. Neither can live without the other. </p>
                                <p>Shaolin Systems have always been referred to as external, not because they are only hard but because they first came from outside of China, or external from the local people. And Tai Chi Chuan was an internal system because it first came from within China, from the internal or inside of the country or people. At higher skill levels there are more similarities than differences between the two, i.e. we learn complete focus with no extra tension.</p>

                                <p>Meditation is simply relaxing the mind. But simple is not always easy. The more relaxed the mind the better it can function, react, be fully aware. Techniques are taught to aid in this process. Tai Chi is sometimes referred to as, “meditation in motion”. Good meditation can calm a busy mind or stimulate a dull one. It can bring us back to center.</p>
