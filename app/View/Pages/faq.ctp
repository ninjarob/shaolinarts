I convinced Jen to come with me because I knew that if Kung Fu was to be a part my life it                better be a part of hers ... I was thrilled that I was going to learn something that I had desired my                entire life and Jen was thrilled that I was finally going to shut up about it. It has taken several                years to be able to see the effects that Shaolin Ch'uan Fa has had on my life and I would like to                explain a few of them. First and foremost it has made me feel like I am 13 again. <em>I feel like I can                    move better now than I have since high school. My stress level is 10% of what it used</em> to be and                my stomach problems are much more manageable than ever before. I feel like I have found what has been                calling to me all of these years and studying Shaolin Ch'uan Fa is now as comfortable as laying in a                hammock on a Sunday afternoon. Since childhood I have wanted to know the mystery behind the martial arts                and the truth is what drives my studies now and for the rest of my life.</p>            <p>Alex Thomas</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('Mark-calig.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin chuan fa, kung fu, mixed martial arts, tai CHi chuan')) ?>            <p>A great privilege for Shaolin Arts students to study with a great Calligrapher. Duanran Fan is a                professor of calligraphy at Yunnan University. He was born and raised in Kunming, China, where he had                spent nearly forty years on calligraphy.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('butterfly-swords.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Kung fu, mixed martial arts, karate, weapons,')) ?>            <p>We wanted to let you know how pleased we are with Brandon’s progress. The changes we are seeing in him                are great! Brandon is <em>more responsible</em> both at home and at school. He does his homework more                willingly. His chores are done with less fuss. He is<em> less aggressive</em> with his little brother                and sister. We have also seen his <em>confidence increase.</em> He is also more <em>respectful </em>towards                us. The four months he has taken lessons have been well worth the money the lessons cost. We checked                several studios before we chose you.

It is a beautiful combination of art and science. By practicing, I                get to play and cultivate creative potentials. I also gain insight into physiology and health benefits.                The more I learn, the more I see these elements blend, and I become more aware of how I can flow between                them. <em>Tai Chi helps me discover</em> my imbalances and allows me to work on becoming centered. I can                vary forms to fit my daily needs and can satisfy curiosities as well. I can then apply these new ideas                and principles to other aspects of my life. I feel more <em>centered </em>and fulfilled                <em>creatively</em> from my Tai Chi study than I have after years of studying dance. By studying Tai Chi                at Shaolin Arts, I let go of myself and gain more than I can ever imagine. The <em>discoveries never                    stop.</em> I learn something new each time I run forms, practice Chi Kung exercises, or meditate.                Best of all, I have the chance to be childlike: to learn, explore, dance and play, and strive to enjoy                each moment in my life.</p>            <p>Lori Nichol</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('randy.jpg', array('alt'=>'shaolin kunf fu, mixed martial arts, karate, self defense, fitness, Tai CHi Chuan,')) ?>            <p>"This is the reason why I wanted to be involved in Shaolin arts. Not only using my own body but also many                kinds of <em>weapons </em>will give me more diverse strength as a whole. Training my<em> inner                    strength </em>... should be my life-long theme no matter what I would do in a future but the idea of                Zen Ken Ki Itsu was actually coming from the Shaolin Temple. Therefore, I feel like I have finally                reached the art that fits my idea that Improves me."</p>            <p>Randy Adachi</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('maleYouth.jpg', array('alt'=>'Male Youth Studying Shaolin Chuan Fa')) ?>            <p>I have always been interested in oriental culture, especially the martial arts. Visions of ninja warriors                from movies who seemed to possess superpowers, and scenes from "Kung Fu Theatre" probably sparked my                love for the arts. Throughout my life, I have taken lessons from several different studios, but the                lessons were not enough to keep my interest. In addition to my love of the orient, I feel it is very                important to be in shape. When I first joined Shaolin Arts, I was <em>forty pounds overweight and                    depressed</em>. A little over a year later, I have lost all of my excess weight and am in the <em>best                    shape of my life</em>--physically, mentally, and spiritually. As a side effect from doing something                I think is fun and good exercise, I have developed a good understanding of how to <em>defend my loved                    ones</em> and myself if violence ever strikes.

Both arts have helped me maintain <em>mental sharpness, remarkable physical                    condition, </em>and great <em>confidence</em> in my abilities.

Sincerely,</p>            <p>Gordon Hellstrom</p>        </aside>    </div>    <div class="col-md-9 sectionContent">        <section class="contentCol">            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>            <p>Below is a summary of some commonly asked questions. Much of this information can also be found                throughout the website, but is here to make the information easier to find. If you have questions                that aren't addressed here, use the phone numbers at the bottom of the page to contact the nearest                studio and they will be happy to help you.</p>            <h3>How much do lessons cost?</h3>            <p>Prices will range from $6.50 / lesson and up, depending what your desires and needs are. The main                point is to make sure you are getting your money's worth. We are each individuals with individual                needs. Shaolin Arts is not the cheapest, nor the most expensive, just the best - and we will                guarantee you'll get your moneys worth.</p>            <h3>What are the class schedules?</h3>            <p>Each studio will have a little bit different class schedules to match the needs of the community it                is located in. We are teaching six days a week and therefore can match most people's schedules. Just                call and set up a time.</p>            <h3>How much time will I need to devote to learn the Arts?</h3>            <p>There is no set time each person is required to come in. Twice a week works well. Once a week is                common for those traveling a lot. Use us as a school. Learn, take our principles with you wherever                you go and you will grow. Some individuals come in everyday and programs are set up for them, and we                have programs that we take to private homes and businesses where the individuals or groups rarely,                if ever, come to the studio location. The more you can be involved the better. But, quality is more                important than quantity. Take the time you have and really use it, and you'll grow.</p>            <h3>What are the qualifications of your instructors?</h3>            <p>Each of our instructors must be well trained in the Arts they are teaching, and they must be trained                in teaching those arts. They must complete our instructors college, serve an apprentice program, and                pass background security checks. They must certify under the international PAI association, and must                continue to certify in all these areas as long as they wish to represent Shaolin Arts in any                professional capacity.</p>            <h3>What style/type of Arts is best?</h3>            <p>Shaolin Arts has always provided a complete program, because that's what works. Kicks, punches,                stances, defense, grappling, chin na, offense, chi, healing, philosophy, health, sport, street,                weapons, etc. Some individuals do come in for just one piece or style of the Arts, which is fine,                but we do like to teach the full program when possible. It's fun, it's real, and it works. Let us                know, and we will set up the best program for your interests and needs.</p>            <h3>Will Martial Arts make my child more aggressive?</h3>            <p>No. A well-run program will decrease aggression, channeling youth energy to positive activities. We                all get frustrated, youth too. Frustration does not need to become anger. Discovering you can have                control of your circumstances is a wonderful feeling, a powerful feeling. The feeling of true                freedom all ages desire.</p>            <h3>How safe is it?</h3>            <p>Shaolin Arts studios pride themselves on their excellent safety record. Far more injuries occur in so                called, non-contact sports, such as basketball. You do not have to be hurt, nor hurt another, to                learn good martial arts, self defense, kung fu or Tai Chi. The Arts were designed to make you                healthier and stronger, not weaker.</p>            <h3>What kind of shape should I be in before I start?</h3>            <p>You can start classes in whatever physical condition you're currently in. Being in perfect shape                would be nice, but to be in perfect shape you'd likely already be doing one of our programs. Our                programs are designed to take you from where you are to where you want to be. Just come and tell us                what you want. We'll take care of the rest.</p>            <h3>Am I too old?</h3>            <p>Currently, our oldest student to date is 87. With each age comes a different set of life experiences,                abilities and desires. The trick is to match the program up with you, the individual.</p>            <h3>Why do I need to wear a uniform?</h3>            <p>Uniforms accelerate the learning process. They are just clothes that work best for the given                activity. They are safe, functional, create a mood, and convey information. They are used because                they make a significant difference.</p>            <h3>What's the best age to start my child in martial arts?</h3>            <p>3 ½ is typically the youngest and it works well when they study with a parent. Five or six is more                common, depending on their coordination and mental maturity. A five minute in person consultation                will give you excellent feedback.</p>            <h3>Is it a religion?</h3>            <p>No. Many religious people do study the Arts, and the basic philosophies complement good core values,                but there is no religion involved. Good Arts must be built upon true principles to work and last,                just like good people must be built upon to be their best and last.</p>            <h3>Why do I have to come into the studio to get all the information?</h3>            <p>Coming into a Shaolin Arts studio location allow us to meet you and you to meet us. It doesn't have                to take very long. It's the best way to give you accurate information, to see you, the unique                individual, we are speaking about. We can better recommend certain programs, explain all we have to                offer, and you can take your pick. It is a free consultation, but it's worth a lot.</p>            <h3>Can I just learn from a DVD?</h3>            <p>Yes and no. DVD's, videos, and movies can help remind us what we have already been taught. Learning                new skills is difficult and refining almost impossible by watching a video. Five minutes of details                with a good instructor will save hours of effort and a lifetime of errors.</p>            <h3>Why the colored sashes?</h3>            <p>Rank, belts or sashes are part of the uniform and are colored to represent your progression through                the different skill levels. They create motivation, organization and safety. A good program will                teach you in a safe progression, called rank, so that your body is ready for the next set of                material. It is a wonderful way to set you up for success after success. Sashes tend to work better                than belts in protecting the Dan Tian, thus they are used.</p>            <h3>What is reviewing for rank all about?</h3>            <p>The main reason for testing or reviewing for rank is for your experience and growth. Each rank review                will be longer than the previous one because you have more material to review and you will be in                better shape to review it. Only you can 'earn' your next rank. Not your parent or spouse. Again, no                one is interested in setting you up for failure. Each review is designed for your learning                experience and benefit.</p>            <h3>How long will it take to learn?</h3>            <p>It can take just a moment of correct instruction to realize the potential the Arts can give us. Real                change does take time. The first difference happens within 3 months, then 6 months, etc. Some people                will have set goals, which can be reached in a set time period, and then they will come in from time                to time for a review or refresher. Others discover there is a lifetime of material available - a                lifetime of growth, adventure, fun. Shaolin Arts strives to make each class worthwhile. All of us                have found remaining active in the Arts improves our quality of life, our very whole being. Staying                active makes everything else we do better.</p>            <h3>What's all the shouting about?</h3>            <p>The shout, the Kiai' or 'Qihe' helps you focus your energy. At first it is more external and with                proper practice, becomes more internal. The sound itself is unimportant. We will all develop our own                sounds or tones as we advance. It is the results we are after not just the sound effects. This is                not to be confused with the classic healing sounds taught in our Qi Gung exercises.</p>            <h3>Are traditional or modern techniques best?</h3>            <p>Traditional often refers to old or ancient ways verses modern relating to our own time period and                circumstances. In the Arts something that is thousands of years old may be just old and outdated, or                it might mean is has 'stood the test of time', that all through the ages nothing has ever been                invented better. Certain techniques worked in the past because of the core principles they utilized                and therefore will work well now, in our times and circumstances if we can be taught the same                methods. When we understand why and how things worked in the past we can have all their strengths                for the future.</p>            <h3>Do you teach how to use weapons?</h3>            <p>Yes. Weapons are an extension of the body. Any error the body makes the weapon will exaggerate.                Therefore weapon training can give the body great feedback. They are wonderful tools for developing                the mind and body. Certain traditional weapons aid in this process more than others. Thus at Shaolin                Arts, for those students who are interested, we like to introduce classic or traditional weapons                training. Secondly, weapons are a part of our society. Understanding how they work increases our                understanding of how to defend against them.</p>            <h3>How do sport and competition skills relate to 'street' skills?</h3>            <p>There are many masters of the Arts who feel and have experienced how sport and competition have                destroyed the Arts. How techniques were ruined that had to be 'watered down' to make them safe                enough for playing around with but never really used. How the skills deteriorated when all one had                to do was pretend to hit rather than have to make their movements work. How more trophies are won by                the Hollywood type appearance of energy and power rather than real power and ability.</p>            <p>On the other hand, sport or competition type activities can develop the desirable skills of                coordinating your movements with another's. Good sportsman-like behaviors can develop with well-run                activities. The idea is to use sport for the strengths it can develop and not confuse sport skills                with true street or fighting skills. At Shaolin Arts, you can have Arts that are fun to do and still                be powerful and effective.</p>            <h3>Do you have to be Asian to study, or to teach?</h3>            <p>No. Neither the color of your skin, nor the birthplace of your parents is as important as your own                desires, motivation and dedication. Learning from a mystical stranger from some foreign land can be                fun at first and impress others but in the long run you learn through good communication and                teaching skills. Remember, the greatest Arts did develop in the area we now call China, by both                Chinese and non-Chinese. They came from throughout the world to share and grow (see history section                for more details).</p>            <h3>Can you really kill someone by just a touch?</h3>            <p>Yes. It is commonly referred to Dim Mak, but it is an uncommon skill. Chi, or internal force is                needed with an understanding of how energy flows through the body. Tapping into these energy sources                can trigger significant results, both to heal and to disrupt. Experience with massage, acupressure                or acupuncture can help develop our awareness.</p>            <h3>What is meant by internal verses external?</h3>            <p>Many refer to the Arts as either internal, meaning developing or dealing with the internal parts of                the body, and external, meaning the external or outer shell of the body. Internal is likewise                thought of, as being soft or gentle in movement while external is only hard or focused. There really                is no such thing in the Arts. Rather there is some degree of both in all. One type or style of Art                may have become known for being more soft or hard, gentle or focused, but both are still needed,                just like the outside of the body has need of the inside and the inside needs the outside. Neither                can live without the other.</p>            <p>Shaolin Systems have always been referred to as external, not because they are only hard but because                they first came from outside of China, or external from the local people. And Tai Chi Chuan was an                internal system because it first came from within China, from the internal or inside of the country                or people. At higher skill levels there are more similarities than differences between the two, i.e.                we learn complete focus with no extra tension.</p>            <h3>What is meditation?</h3>            <p>Meditation is simply relaxing the mind. But simple is not always easy. The more relaxed the mind the                better it can function, react, be fully aware. Techniques are taught to aid in this process. Tai Chi                is sometimes referred to as, “meditation in motion”. Good meditation can calm a busy mind or                stimulate a dull one. It can bring us back to center.</p>            <h3>What is the significance of the bowing?</h3>            <p>Bowing in the Arts is like a handshake without the transfer of germs. It is a greeting to the                physical training area, and one another. Like a handshake, bows can have different meanings, and can                transfer many feelings. Students enjoy learning to express themselves and understanding the body                languages bowing can radiate.</p>        </section>    </div></div>
