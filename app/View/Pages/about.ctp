Sixteen months ago, he started out totally focused on kick boxing. You kindly but firmly informed                him that a few basics were in order, then other things would follow. Many good things have followed.                <em>Eric has a hard time staying with a task.</em> I have been very pleased with the patience shown him,                the reminders at appropriate intervals, and diversity of training that eliminates boredom. He comes home                after nearly every lesson having learned a new technique, a new defense and wants to tell us all about                it. <em>In his fifteen years, he has never stayed interestied in anything for more than a few                    weeks.</em> With every lesson, with every advancement, he looks forward to the next goal ... These                things are good, but they are not all. <em>He is learning patience and exhibits more with his                    family.</em> He understands that just because he can’t have something right now does not mean he can                never have it. He is less eager to fight. He has learned the value of keeping his composure and walking                away from a confrontation - even one he knows he can win. He shows his friends and siblings greater                respect, and he shows his mother and me much more respect. <em>We have fewer arguments,</em> and he is                slower to anger when we do. <em>He is more grateful, more attentive, more kind.</em> Self-confidence has                never been an issue with Eric, but the display of confidence has subtly shifted from self-absorbed                bravado to quiet strength. No, I don’t think that you, John, Josh, etc. all are solely responsible. But                <em>you have helped reinforce the values and principles we try to teach him at home.</em> You have                helped fashion my son in a way unavailable to me as a father. You have taught him true and correct                principles, in the setting of Martial Arts, which are applicable to his life. You have been teachers,                mentors and friends. My thanks for your genuine and sincere efforts. I may pay you for your time as you                teach my son, but you have also <em>given him things that cannot be bought... honesty, integrity,                    respect, and goodness.</em></p>            <p>Respectfully,<br/>                John David Moran</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('Mom-Son.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin chuan fa, five animal kung fu, fitness, self defense, mixed martial arts, karate, weapons,')) ?>            <p>1993 I just wanted to share our experience with this studio and their kung fu program. My son, TJ, has                had an interest in martial arts since he was a little tiny boy. I thought it was just a passing fancy,                and so I would just put him off when he would beg to take lessons. As he grew older, he continued with a                great interest. TJ had three older brothers who play all sorts of team sports, as he has himself, but I                felt that he didn't feel he could ever measure up to their ability. <em>He seemed to not be feeling very                    good about himself to me,</em> and I began to search for something that I felt would help. That is                when karate entered the picture. He was so excited when I told him I thought it would be a great thing                for him to try, and so I began checking around. <em>This studio came very highly recommended</em> to me                by a friend whose son took lessons here. She had previously checked around and had a very bad experience                elsewhere. <em>I have found that kung fu has been absolutely the answer for TJ.</em> He has learned a                great deal of discipline from this experience, and he has definitely had a <em>great boost in his self                    esteem.</em> I have found your studio very professional and very excellent in every way. They are                willing to listen if a concern develops, and handle any problems that might arise in a very appropriate                manner. Kung Fu has been everything that I'd ever hoped it would be for TJ and <em>I'm so glad I found                    Shaolin Arts.</em></p>            <p>Sincerely,<br/> Jan England</p>            <h2>The Rules of Nine</h2>            <p>Keep yourself disciplined in all situations. </p>            <p>Choose the middle path of harmony; never go to extremes.</p>            <p>Be humble; do not show off. </p>            <p>Be honest with yourself and others. </p>            <p>Do not criticize other styles – there is good in most things. </p>            <p>Remain courteous. </p>            <p>Persevere and put heart and mind into all you do. </p>            <p>Accept and exhibit responsible behavior, cooperation and respect. </p>            <p>Avoid fights or situations where confrontations are likely.</p>            <p>By remaining true to the above nine, one shows respect for oneself, for their instructors, for the                ancestors of the arts, and for the art.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('markHchi2.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Kung Fu, Chen Tai Chi Chuan, mixed martial arts, self defense, fitness,')) ?>            <p><em>I am constantly amazed with Tai Chi. It is a beautiful combination of art and science.</em> By                practicing, I get to play and cultivate creative potentials. I also gain insight into physiology and                health benefits. The more I learn, the more I see these elements blend, and I become more aware of how I                can flow between them. <em>Tai Chi helps me discover</em> my imbalances and allows me to work on                becoming centered. I can vary forms to fit my daily needs and can satisfy curiosities as well. I can                then apply these new ideas and principles to other aspects of my life.<em> I feel more centered and                    fulfilled creatively</em> from my Tai Chi study than I have after years of studying dance. By                studying Tai Chi at Shaolin Arts, I let go of myself and <em>gain more than I can ever imagine. The                    discoveries never stop.</em> I learn something new each time I run forms, practice Chi Kung                exercises, or meditate. Best of all, I have the chance to be childlike: to learn, explore, dance and                play, and strive to enjoy each moment in my life.

Shaolin literally means, "little pine forest", which described the location of the                first Shaolin School of learning, or Temple, a location of knowledge and skill development. It was an                international Art first based in what is now called China at a time period when China was a world leader                in science, technology, production and population. In this environment it flourished to become known in                all the civilized world as the best system with most of today"s Arts evolving from it's teachings.                Styles commonly now known as Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, grappling, Jujitsu, Chi Gung, Tae Kwon Do, Wushu,                Mixed Martial Arts, are all English expressions of styles taken from the ancient Shaolin teachings and                methods.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('HolladayStudio.gif', array('alt'=>'kung fu class, tai chi, qi gung, martial arts instruction')) ?>            <p>In North America, over the past 60 years, Shaolin Kung Fu Chuan Fa and Tai Chi Chuan, was taught to                family members and select friends. It is a Gar system, or family system, passed down from family member                to family member, and at times their close friends. Other Martial Arts organizations were involved from                time to time, but all lacked depth and unity, resulting in the organization known as "Shaolin Arts". A                name designed to give credit where credit was due: To the great history of the arts and the many Masters                who have honored it, both past and present. To promote the best the arts have, that is, to develop the                best in each of us, that we may all have the personal development desired, and be an asset within our                own communities.</p>            <p>Students at the Shaolin Arts studios range from 3 1/2 to 87 years of age, with equal mixes of youth,                adults, men and women. We offer group and private lessons, clinics, seminars, as well as specialty group                lessons designed for families, firemen, police, bodyguards, medical emergency room staff, youth groups,                businesses, and the elderly. We have classes in self defense, fitness, flexibility, stress management,                weight management and Chi or energy development. We have taught not only the professional athlete but                blind students, individuals in wheel chairs, overweight, underweight, attention deficient disorders, and                developmentally delayed individuals. Each has grown due to their involvement with our programs.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('SandyStudiofront.gif', array('alt'=>'Sandy Shaolin Arts Studio')) ?>            <p>We do not require contracts as we feel if classes are good they will sell themselves. Individuals are                welcomed just to drop in, but setting up an appointment is suggested so that we can take more personal                time with you.</p>            <p>At Shaolin Arts we teach by the five classic Shaolin Animals: tiger, leopard, dragon, crane, snake, and,                Chen style Tai Chi Chuan.</p>            <p>Within the animal styles each animal represents a different body type and personality.</p>            <p><strong>The tiger</strong> is known for its strength and tenacity. It is used to being the biggest and                strongest animal in the jungle using direct force in confrontations. As long as you are the biggest and                strongest tiger this is a good method. The weakness of the tiger is that it can be "out foxed".</p>            <p><strong>The leopard</strong> is known for its speed. Rapid multiple strikes with coordinated footwork are                utilized.</p>            <p><strong>The dragon</strong> is mystical. It is the thinker. Whipping and whirling with hidden strikes is                its trademark.</p>            <p><strong>The crane</strong> is known for its balance. It is more conservative, keeping its main body back                while reaching out with its wings and beak. The last thing the crane wants to do is grapple.</p>            <p><strong>The snake</strong> uses wrapping movements and poisonous strikes. The sports of judo, jujitsu,                wrestling, and aikido all came from the snake. Poisonous strikes are related to pressure point strikes.            </p>            <p>Our Tai Chi programs are designed for health, fitness, balance, relaxation, awareness, harmony, and                energy development. Time has proven again and again the wonderful benefits of Tai Chi practice. This                gentle yet invigorating exercise can have amazing effects on the entire body and mind. Chen style Tai                Chi's principles of power generation are famous in both the healing and defensive arts.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('GlendaleStudio.jpg', array('alt'=>'Glendale Shaolin Arts Studio')) ?>            <p>Just like people, each Shaolin Art animal has its strengths and weakness due to individual body style and                personality. For example, in self defense applications, kicks are an excellent tool, but if you are                standing on a patch of ice, wearing a tight dress, you may not be able to throw too many kicks. If                someone gets behind you and pulls you down to the ground, different skills are needed. What if you have                more than one attacker, or weapons are used? Putting all the animal styles together, as was                traditionally done, creates a more complete package, system of martial arts, mixed martial arts is a                common descriptive term used in today's language. Our goal is to teach you all the principles of the                arts, and you will naturally gravitate to the style that works best for you. We do have students who                study just one aspect of the art. It may be a weapon, self defense, sport, or the internal. Let us know                ahead of time, and we can set up a specialized program.</p>            <p>The strength of studying a complete system is its depth; the weakness is a lot of information is shared.                If someone is after a quick rank, say a black belt, studying just one part of an art often results in                quicker rank within that style. Rank obtained within a specialized style is often only recognized within                that style, or even limited to that individual studio location.</p>            <?php echo $this->Html->image('youthGroup.jpg', array('alt'=>'Shaolin Chuan Fa, Kung Fu, mixed martial arts, youth, self defense, fitness')) ?>            <h4>Weapons</h4>            <p>Weapons are an extension of the body, therefore a wonderful tool to learn about oneself, learning to                extend energy past your limbs, to center yourself properly, to increase sensitivity and total awareness.                At Shaolin Arts, traditional weapons are taught for the above-mentioned benefits, plus modern weapons,                or weapons found within our society, since understanding how any weapon works also results in better                understanding of how to defend against them.</p>            <p>Knowledge is power, but most important, the correct responsible use of knowledge is freedom.</p>            <p>Zheng, a 16-century military analyst, wrote: “In today"s martial arts, there is no one in the land who                does not yield to Shaolin. Funiu Monks should be ranked as second, for these monks seeking to protect                themselves studied Shaolin. … together, these centers comprise hundreds of monasteries and countless                monks. Our land is beset by bandits inside and barbarians outside. If the government issues an order for                these monks recruitment it will win every battle”.</p>            <p>Anciently, Shaolin practitioners were healers, educators, a source of knowledge for an entire community.                The systems of Shaolin did become world famous in violent times due to fighting skills, yet they were                most respected for their wisdom and services performed. They became sources of truth, knowledge and                skills for entire communities and countries, whether it be healing or protecting - just like we each                need today.</p>        </section>    </div></div>
