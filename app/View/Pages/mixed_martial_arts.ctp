During my study with [ another Martial Arts organization ] I began noticing                how my <em>techniques didn't actually work</em>. I couldn't figure out how or why, and I began feeling                as if I was paying a lot of money to memorize movements … Subsequently I began falling away from the                arts … Several years later I heard of Shaolin Arts ... I have always liked the 5 animal style and I felt                inclined to check out a studio. Because I have studied martial arts before, I knew what to look for, or                better yet - how "I wanted to" <em>qualify the instructor</em>. I didn't want to waste me time with an                instructor who lacked the passion for the arts, cared more about the business than his students and most                importantly failed to show me "he" … actually knew and understood what he was teaching. I paid a visit                to the Taylorsville studio where I asked to view a class … My mouth dropped immediately and I could not                believe what I was seeing. He was having fun with his students and he made time to answer all of their                questions. More importantly, I watched the way he moved, as I had never seen an instructor move like                that. I was greatly impressed. Here, was an instructor [with] great understanding of why and how along                with different variations of the technique for the <em>different body types</em> … He did not pressure                me, nor did he want me to sign any <em>type of contract</em>. He stated to me, "if you don't like what 1                am teaching you are free to leave, I want to earn you business every month". What more can be said? I                quickly joined and began my training.</p>            <p>Kent Cottle</p>        </aside>    </div>    <div class="col-md-9 sectionContent">        <section class="contentCol">            <h2>Mixed Martial Arts</h2>            <p>Martial Art has become a term referring to the fighting side of the Arts. Mixed Martial Arts has become                an American term referring to more than one style of Martial Arts. MMA, meaning mixed martial arts, has                become a sporting contest in North America where punches, kicks, and grappling are used to entertain                spectators.</p>            <img src="img/lowbowdemotream.jpg"                 alt="Shaolin Arts, kung fu, mixed martial arts, karate, Qi Gung, self defense, fitness,"/>            <p>Anciently, all Arts were taught under one roof and students would rotate through different wings or halls                learning different styles or techniques. Thus they would learn a full system of the Arts. Over time, it                became common to only learn one piece of the Arts, one style. It may be just the kicks, such as in Tae                Kwon Do, or just the ground fighting as in Jujitsu, redirecting energy as in Aikido, or a force meets                force philosophy of Karate. Each of these pieces of the whole can be fun and rewarding to be involved in                and if all you want is one piece then by all means just do that part or piece. But, tIme has proven over                and over again, the weakness of limiting to only one style, only having one way of dealing with                life.</p>            <img src="img/3girlscutoutGrey.jpg"                 alt="Shaolin Kung Fu, Kicks, mixed martial arts, fitness, self defense"/>            <p>long range, to close range</p>            <img src="img/darrensarahlockGrey.jpg"                 alt="long range, to close range  Shaolin Chuan Fa, kung fu, mixed martial arts, karate, self defense, fitness,"/>            <p>At Shaolin Arts we have always used a complete program of the Arts. With the traditional five animal                styles we teach, long range kicking, closer range punching, knees, elbows into even close range Chin Na                or grappling jujitsu are fundamental to our system and always have been. This is why our self defense                systems work so well. Students will have techniques that work for any body type, against any body type,                in any environment.</p>            <img src="img/Josh-1.jpg" alt="Shaolin kung fu, mixed martial arts, fitness, seld defense,"/>            <p>You can learn just one piece of the Martial Arts, such as kicks or ground fighting and we will be happy                to teach you, but whenever we can, we like to teach the whole system. All the kicks, punches, hand                strikes, grabs, controls, ground techniques, healing's, pressure points, etc. You can have a part or                have it all.
